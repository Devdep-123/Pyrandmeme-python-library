# Pyrandmeme-python-library

I decided to create this repository to show how I made my first ever python library:

**What does the library do?**
This library simply uses aiohttp to collect json data from a reddit page and turns it into a link inorder to be used. 
I fully encourage people to check out the __init__.py file to see the exact code I used.
