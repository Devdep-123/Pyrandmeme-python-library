# Pyrandmeme-python-library

**What does the library do?**
This library simply uses aiohttp to collect json data from a reddit page and turns it into a link inorder to be used while also storing the memes and returning the meme as a discord embed before sending back to the discord bot to send to the member who sent that command.
